# Netflix-vs-Amazon-Prime-Project
This project focuses on analyzing the content libraries of Netflix and Amazon Prime using Tableau. It includes three dashboards: one detailing Netflix's library with a geographical and genre focus, another analyzing Amazon Prime's content with an emphasis on movies, and a comparative dashboard highlighting differences in content offerings, geographical reach, and genre distribution between the two platforms. The project also addresses challenges like harmonizing genre classifications and integrating dynamic filters. This comprehensive analysis aims to aid in understanding streaming content trends and strategic decision-making in the digital entertainment industry.
